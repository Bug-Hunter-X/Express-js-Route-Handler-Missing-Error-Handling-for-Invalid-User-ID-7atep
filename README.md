# Express.js Route Handler Missing Error Handling for Invalid User ID

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js route handlers: the lack of error handling for invalid input. Specifically, this example shows a route that fetches a user by ID, but fails to handle cases where the ID is not a valid integer.

## Bug

The `bug.js` file contains the problematic code.  The route handler attempts to parse the user ID as an integer without any validation.  If the ID is not a number (e.g., a string or null), `parseInt(userId)` will return `NaN`, and the `find` method will fail to find the user, resulting in a null value for `user`.  This will not throw an error but may lead to unexpected application behavior or crashes, especially if the application continues to use the undefined `user` object.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version.  The improved handler now includes explicit checks to ensure the `userId` is a number before attempting to parse it and search for the user. If an error occurs or the user is not found, an appropriate error response is sent to the client.
